# Step-competition

What I'm hoping for is a step counter that could be dedicated to a class or house competition. This means that there must be a way for the user to sign up as a member of a particular team. I'm guessing that QR codes could be set up for this. Also, I want to be sure that only students and faculty can sign (to prevent recruitment of friends and family);

Ideally, this step counter will be able to differentiate between steps on stairs and steps on a level surface. A separate counter for each would be best, I think. This way, organizers of any competition would be able to determine how they use those two counts. I think other schools and organizations would be interested in such a step counter.
Now for the hard part: Do you think you could figure out a way to NOT count steps if the phone is being held in the user's hand? Or at least not count the steps on stairs? I've noticed that the step-counter for WeChat doesn't count steps very well, if the phone is being held (for instance, when using a map to navigate in a strange city). I have a Xiaomi Mix2 phone;

If you think about it, this must be a sensitivity/detection issue, and I don't know if various phones will be similar. It might take some serious testing to figure that part out.
Let me know what you think. If there are other students interested in being involved, just include them in any reply you have, so we can get everyone connected;
